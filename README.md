My name is Zanqi. I'm a student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) of the University of Washington. I am researching in the [Robotic Manipulation Lab](https://robotic-manipulation.sciencehub.uw.edu/).

Here you will find some of my learning over time. I think building and deriving from scratch is the best way to learn. I hope this blog will help you in your learning journey too.

## CV
Here is my [CV](/files/cv_zanqi.pdf).
