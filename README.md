## Hello World!
![img](/images/zanqi_photo.jpeg){: width="360" height="360" style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;margin-left: 15px"}

My name is Zanqi. I'm a Computer Science student at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) specializing in Systems.

I am driven by the challenge of making software reliable and fast. My current focus is on **Operating Systems**, **Distributed Systems**, and **Performance Engineering**. I enjoy building core infrastructure from scratch to truly understand the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and latency.

On this blog, you'll find my technical deep dives—like debugging Paxos protocol failures or analyzing system bottlenecks—documented as I learn.

## Get in Touch
I am currently looking for System Software internship opportunities for Summer 2026.
If you'd like to chat about systems, performance, or potential roles, please email me at [zanqil@uw.edu](mailto:zanqil@uw.edu).
